    <!-- to confirm that you are locally hosting an image, go into your server and
    type in what you think is the address that'll lead to your image. the image
    should show up -->
    <!-- whatever is hosted is reflective of your file system/structure -->
    <!-- atom is just a way to show files, but it is an absolute mirror of your <fieldset>
      system -->
    <!-- alt text is important for disabled and so people know what the image is
    the case it doesn't load and is broken -->

    <p> adding a link </p>
    <p>This paragraph <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">contains</a> a link</p>
    <!-- target blank tells the browser to open in a new tab, but there are a lot
    of different targets -->
    <!-- you need the https:// for external links, or else it will think it's local -->
    <h2>This <a href="https://www.twitter.com"> header </a> contains a link</h2>
    <p> This goes to <a href="second.html"> locally hosted page </a></p>
